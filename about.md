I am Usman Anwar. I read and learn about Machine Learning. Sometimes I blog about it too. Reach me at [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/usmananwar345), [twitter](www.twitter.com/rantistan) or [email](usmananwar391@gmail.com). 

I am also currently managing [Spectra Magazine](www.spectramagazine.org). Check that out as well. If you want to contribute to Spectra, in any capacity, drop me an email at usman@spectramagazine.org
